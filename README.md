# WindSensor
A DIY Wind sensor interface board.

This connects to various anemometer types and provides a serial interface for averaged data from the pulses

It walso connects to wind vanes and returns information relating to the wind direction (if required).

It runs on an ATTiny85 with 9600 baud serial.

Each unit can have a unique ID, so multiple units can be added to a serial bus.
